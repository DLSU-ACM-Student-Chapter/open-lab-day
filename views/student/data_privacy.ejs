      <h1>ACM Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Our organization is committed to protecting the privacy and security of
        our members. For attendance tracking, we collect the unique user
        identifier (known as sub) provided by Google during authentication. This
        identifier is securely hashed using a one-way hash before being stored
        in our systems, ensuring that it cannot be reversed to reveal the
        original identifier. No additional personal information is collected or
        retained in our attendance records. We only store the student ID number
        associated with each individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        We retain the hashed identifiers and student ID numbers only for as long
        as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which they were collected, or
        as required by law. Once the data is no longer needed, it will be
        securely deleted to protect the privacy of our members.
